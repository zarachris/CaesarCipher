Important: We are preparing an attack of Charly's computer server by a Wardriving attack this week.
We will attempt a passive attack of their network and search the access point. We will listen to the radio traffic with a scanner and try to decrypt the WPA key.
Here is my position:
latitude forty one degrees seven minutes forty one point four two seconds North, longitude one degree fifteen minutes twenty point six seven seconds East.
Unlimited budget required.
